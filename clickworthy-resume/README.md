# clickworthy-resume

This library provides components and styles to create a visually appealing and effective resume/CV using [Typst](https://typst.app).

The version of library used here can be found here: [clickworthy-resume 140d751](https://github.com/AbdullahHendy/clickworthy-resume/tree/140d75133e9f9209f57ea18ca21d97ef6cb984b3)

There are few changes made to the original library to suit my needs. The changes can be found using `git blame` the file, as the first the files were introduced, it contained the original code.
